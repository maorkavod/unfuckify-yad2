## This project is obsolete, following yad2's facelift
Some features in this script don't exist in the new yad2, but requires a complete re-work.

## For posterity
This braindead Greasemonkey script adds a few much needed features to yad2.co.il - the place Israelis with no facebook friends go to look for apartments in Tel Aviv:
* Removes a crapton of distracting garbage
* Listings that you haven't seen before are brightly colored
* Creates a listing link so that you can share without having to use the annoying "email this to a friend" dealie
* Lets you downvote an apartment so you don't have to look at it again

Tested with Tampermonkey and Chrome. YMMV.

## Installing
1. In Chrome, install the Tampermonkey extension
2. Click on [the javascript file](https://github.com/pavius/unfuckify-yad2/raw/master/unfuckify-yad2.user.js) - Tampermonkey should catch it and prompt you to install
3. Go to yad2.co.il (shudder) and run a search for rental properties. Things should look different
